  fishFacts:
  - title: Not a True Squid or Octopus
    description: Despite its name, the vampire squid is neither a true squid nor
      an octopus. It belongs to its own order, Vampyromorphida, and is considered
      a "living fossil," meaning it has remained relatively unchanged for millions
      of years.
  - title: Lives in the Oxygen Minimum Zone
    description: "Vampire squids thrive in deep-sea habitats between 2,000\u20133,000
      feet (600\u2013900 meters), where oxygen levels are extremely low (less than
      5%). They have adapted to survive in these harsh conditions with specialized
      hemocyanin in their blood for efficient oxygen transport. "
  - title: Unique Defense Mechanism
    description: Instead of ink, vampire squids eject a cloud of bioluminescent mucus
      filled with glowing particles when threatened. This startles predators and
      gives the squid time to escape.
  - title: '"Inside-Out" Appearance'
    description: When frightened, vampire squids invert their webbed arms over their
      bodies, displaying spiny projections that give them a menacing look. This behavior,
      known as "pineapple posture," is designed to deter predators.
  - title: Diet of Marine Snow
    description: Unlike many cephalopods, vampire squids don't actively hunt large
      prey. They feed on "marine snow," a mix of organic debris, dead plankton, and
      fecal matter that sinks from the ocean's surface. They use specialized filaments
      to collect these particles efficiently.

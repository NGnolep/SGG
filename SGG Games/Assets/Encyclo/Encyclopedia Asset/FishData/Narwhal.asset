  fishFacts:
  - title: Tooth or Tusk?
    description: Male narwhals have a long, spiraled tusk that can reach up to 10
      feet (3 meters), which is actually a single elongated tooth, the left canine,
      that grows through the upper lip. This tusk has sensory capabilities and can
      detect changes in temperature, salinity, and water pressure.
  - title: No Dorsal Fin
    description: Narwhals lack a dorsal fin, unlike most other whales. This adaptation
      allows them to move under Arctic ice more easily without getting stuck.
  - title: Changing Skin Color
    description: 'Narwhals change skin color as they age: babies are bluish-gray,
      adults are a mottled gray, and older narwhals appear almost white.'
  - title: Amazing Diving Abilities
    description: Narwhals are exceptional divers. They can dive up to 4,900 feet
      (1,500 meters) and stay underwater for up to 25 minutes, which helps them forage
      for food on the ocean floor.
  - title: Unique Communication
    description: Narwhals use a range of sounds, including clicks, whistles, and
      knocks, for communication and navigation. These sounds act like sonar, helping
      them detect objects around them, especially in the dark waters of the Arctic.

  fishFacts:
  - title: Massive Size
    description: Giant squids can grow up to 40-50 feet (12-15 meters) in length,
      making them one of the largest invertebrates on Earth. Their eyes alone are
      about the size of a soccer ball, which helps them see in the dark depths of
      the ocean.
  - title: Elusive Nature
    description: Despite their size, giant squids are rarely seen alive. They live
      at depths of around 300-1,000 meters (1,000-3,280 feet), making them hard to
      study. Most of what we know comes from carcasses washed up on shore or caught
      in deep-sea fishing nets.
  - title: Powerful Tentacles and Hooks
    description: They have eight arms and two longer tentacles equipped with hundreds
      of suction cups lined with sharp hooks. These hooks help them latch onto prey
      with an incredibly strong grip, making escape nearly impossible.
  - title: Jet Propulsion
    description: Giant squids use jet propulsion to move through the water. They
      suck water into a cavity in their mantle (main body) and force it out through
      a funnel, enabling them to move swiftly, especially when they need to evade
      predators like sperm whales.
  - title: Mysterious Hunting Tactics
    description: "Little is known about their hunting strategies, but it\u2019s believed
      they ambush prey in the deep ocean, relying on their large eyes to spot bioluminescent
      creatures like fish and smaller squids in the near-total darkness."

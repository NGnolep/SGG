  fishFacts:
  - title: Built for Long-Distance Travel
    description: Great White Sharks are known for their impressive migration abilities,
      sometimes covering thousands of miles. They can travel vast distances, such
      as from South Africa to Australia and back, following seasonal patterns for
      hunting and breeding.
  - title: Temperature Regulation
    description: Unlike most fish, Great Whites are endothermic, meaning they can
      maintain a warmer body temperature than the surrounding water. This adaptation
      helps them hunt in colder waters, giving them an edge over other marine predators.
  - title: Powerful Bite Force
    description: Great Whites have one of the most powerful bite forces among sharks,
      estimated to be between 4,000 and 4,200 pounds per square inch (PSI). Their
      serrated teeth and strong jaws make them incredibly effective hunters.
  - title: A Sixth Sense
    description: "Great Whites use special organs called ampullae of Lorenzini to
      detect electrical signals from other animals. This sense helps them locate
      prey even when it\u2019s hidden, allowing them to detect even the faintest
      heartbeat of a nearby animal."
  - title: Unique Hunting Technique
    description: They often launch themselves upward in powerful, surprise attacks
      to catch seals and other prey, a hunting behavior called breaching. This involves
      the shark propelling itself partially or fully out of the water, which is both
      effective and visually dramatic!

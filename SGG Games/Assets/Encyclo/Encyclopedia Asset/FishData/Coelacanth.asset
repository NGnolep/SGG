  fishFacts:
  - title: '"Living Fossil"'
    description: Coelacanths are often called "living fossils" because they were
      believed to have gone extinct around 66 million years ago until one was discovered
      alive in 1938. They have remained largely unchanged for over 400 million years,
      predating dinosaurs.
  - title: Lobed Fins and Evolutionary Significance
    description: Coelacanths have lobed fins that are supported by bones, resembling
      the limb structure of early tetrapods (four-limbed vertebrates). This makes
      them an important link in studying the evolutionary transition from fish to
      land animals.
  - title: Deep-Sea Dwellers
    description: "Coelacanths inhabit depths of 500\u2013800 meters in underwater
      caves and volcanic slopes. They prefer low-light environments and use their
      unique rostral organ (in their snout) to detect faint electrical signals from
      prey in the dark."
  - title: Incredibly Slow Reproduction
    description: Coelacanths have an unusually long gestation period of about 5 years,
      one of the longest known in any vertebrate. They give birth to live young (ovoviviparous),
      and their reproductive rate is extremely low, contributing to their endangered
      status.
  - title: Unique "Hinged" Jaw
    description: Coelacanths have a secondary hinge in their jaw, allowing them to
      open their mouths wider and consume larger prey. This adaptation is rare among
      fish and helps them feed efficiently in their deep-sea habitat.

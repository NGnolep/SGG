  fishFacts:
  - title: Complex Songs
    description: Male humpback whales are known for their intricate songs, which
      can last up to 20 minutes and are often repeated for hours. These songs are
      believed to play a role in mating, and all males in a particular region sing
      a similar version that gradually changes over time.
  - title: Remarkable Migration
    description: Humpback whales undertake one of the longest migrations of any mammal,
      traveling up to 16,000 miles (25,000 kilometers) each year between feeding
      grounds in polar regions and breeding grounds in tropical or subtropical waters.
  - title: Acrobatic Abilities
    description: Humpbacks are known for their acrobatic behavior, such as breaching
      (leaping out of the water), tail-slapping, and flipper-slapping. These displays
      are thought to be a form of communication, play, or a way to dislodge parasites.
  - title: Bubble-Net Feeding
    description: Humpbacks have a unique feeding technique called bubble-net feeding,
      where a group of whales works together to blow bubbles in a circle around a
      school of fish, creating a "net" that traps the fish and makes them easier
      to catch.
  - title: Long Pectoral Fins
    description: Humpbacks have the longest pectoral fins of any whale species, reaching
      up to 16 feet (5 meters) in length. These fins help with maneuverability and
      stability, and their scientific name, Megaptera, means "big-winged" in reference
      to these impressive fins.

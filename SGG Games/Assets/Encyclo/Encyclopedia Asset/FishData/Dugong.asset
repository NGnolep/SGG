  fishFacts:
  - title: Marine Herbivores
    description: Dugongs are the only strictly herbivorous marine mammals, feeding
      exclusively on seagrass. They are sometimes called "sea cows" because they
      graze in underwater meadows much like cows graze on land.
  - title: Closest Relative to Elephants
    description: Despite their aquatic lifestyle, dugongs are closely related to
      elephants. Both belong to the order Sirenia and share traits like bristle-like
      hairs on their bodies and similar tooth structure.
  - title: Slow Reproduction
    description: "Dugongs have a very low reproductive rate, with females giving
      birth to a single calf every 3\u20137 years. This, combined with habitat loss,
      makes them vulnerable to population decline."
  - title: Lifespan and Size
    description: "Dugongs can live up to 70 years, reaching lengths of 2.5\u20133
      meters (8\u201310 feet) and weighing around 250\u2013300 kg (550\u2013660 pounds).
      Their slow growth and long lifespan make them dependent on stable ecosystems."
  - title: Mythical Inspiration
    description: Dugongs are thought to have inspired ancient sailor legends about
      mermaids. Their graceful movements and human-like nursing behavior may have
      contributed to these myths.

  fishFacts:
  - title: 'Largest Animal on Earth:'
    description: The blue whale is the largest animal to ever exist on Earth, surpassing
      even the largest dinosaurs. They can grow up to 100 feet (30 meters) in length
      and weigh as much as 200 tons, with their tongues alone weighing as much as
      an elephant!
  - title: 'Heart Size and Function:'
    description: A blue whale's heart is massive, weighing around 400 pounds (about
      180 kg), roughly the size of a small car. It beats so powerfully that it can
      be heard from over 2 miles away underwater, but it slows down to only 2 beats
      per minute when the whale dives.
  - title: 'Record-Breaking Loudness:'
    description: "Blue whales are among the loudest animals on Earth, with their
      calls reaching up to 188 decibels\u2014louder than a jet engine. Their low-frequency
      vocalizations can travel hundreds of miles underwater, helping them communicate
      across vast distances."
  - title: 'Massive Food Consumption:'
    description: Blue whales are filter feeders that consume krill, tiny shrimp-like
      creatures. During feeding season, they can eat up to 4 tons (8,000 pounds)
      of krill per day by engulfing huge volumes of water and filtering it through
      their baleen plates.
  - title: 'Longevity and Maturity:'
    description: "Blue whales can live up to 80\u201390 years, and scientists estimate
      their age by counting the layers of wax in their earplugs, much like counting
      tree rings. They reach sexual maturity around 10 years of age and have a slow
      reproduction rate, with a single calf born every 2\u20133 years."

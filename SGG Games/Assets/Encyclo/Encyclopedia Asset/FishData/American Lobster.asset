  fishFacts:
  - title: Longevity and Growth
    description: "American lobsters can live for decades, with some individuals reaching
      up to 50 years or more. They continue to grow throughout their lives by molting,
      shedding their old exoskeleton and growing a new, larger one. Each molt makes
      them larger and more robust, though it\u2019s a vulnerable period where they
      hide to avoid predators."
  - title: Claw Specialization
    description: 'American lobsters have two distinct types of claws: the larger,
      crusher claw, used to break open shells and hard prey like clams, and the smaller,
      pincher (or cutter) claw, which is sharper and used for cutting and tearing
      softer prey.'
  - title: Blue Blood
    description: Lobsters have blue blood due to a copper-based molecule called hemocyanin,
      which carries oxygen in their blood. This is different from the iron-based
      hemoglobin in human blood, which makes ours red.
  - title: Can Regenerate Limbs
    description: Lobsters can regenerate lost limbs, including claws, legs, and antennae,
      though it can take multiple molting cycles for a full claw to grow back to
      its original size. This regeneration ability helps them recover from injuries
      and defend themselves.
  - title: Natural Color Variants
    description: While American lobsters are typically dark greenish-brown, genetic
      mutations can result in rare color variations, including blue, yellow, orange,
      and even albino. These unusual colors are extremely rare, with blue lobsters
      occurring in about one in two million individuals. However, all lobsters turn
      red when cooked due to the heat affecting pigments in their shell.

  fishFacts:
  - title: They Have No Brain or Blood
    description: Starfish lack a centralized brain and blood. Instead, they rely
      on a decentralized nerve network and a water vascular system. Their bodies
      pump seawater to transport nutrients and oxygen.
  - title: They Can Regenerate Arms (or Entire Bodies)
    description: 'Starfish have remarkable regenerative abilities. If they lose an
      arm, it can grow back. In some species, a severed arm can regenerate into a
      whole new starfish, provided part of the central disc is intact. '
  - title: They Have Hundreds of Tube Feet
    description: The underside of a starfish is covered in tiny tube feet operated
      by hydraulic pressure. These feet help them move, adhere to surfaces, and capture
      prey, such as bivalves (clams and mussels).
  - title: They Eat by Turning Their Stomach Inside Out
    description: Starfish have a unique feeding method. They eject their stomachs
      through their mouths to envelop and digest prey externally before pulling the
      stomach back in.
  - title: They Come in Many Shapes and Sizes
    description: There are over 2,000 species of starfish worldwide, ranging in size
      from less than an inch to over 3 feet in diameter. They also display a wide
      range of colors and patterns, adapting to their environments and deterring
      predators.

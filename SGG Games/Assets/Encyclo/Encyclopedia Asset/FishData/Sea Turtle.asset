  fishFacts:
  - title: Ancient Lineage
    description: "Sea turtles have been around for more than 100 million years, meaning
      they coexisted with dinosaurs. They\u2019re among the most ancient reptiles
      still alive today, surviving multiple extinction events and adapting over millions
      of years."
  - title: 'Long Migration Patterns '
    description: Sea turtles are known for their long-distance migrations, traveling
      thousands of miles between feeding grounds and nesting beaches. Some species,
      like the leatherback, can cross entire oceans to reach their preferred nesting
      spots.
  - title: Navigation by Magnetic Field
    description: "Sea turtles have a remarkable ability to navigate using Earth\u2019s
      magnetic field. They can sense the unique magnetic signatures of different
      coastal areas, which helps them return to the exact beach where they were born
      to lay their own eggs."
  - title: Temperature-Dependent Gender
    description: The temperature of the sand where sea turtle eggs are incubated
      determines the gender of the hatchlings. Warmer sand tends to produce more
      females, while cooler sand produces more males, a phenomenon known as temperature-dependent
      sex determination.
  - title: Respiration Adaptation
    description: Although sea turtles need to surface to breathe air, they can hold
      their breath for several hours while resting. They have specialized muscles
      and blood chemistry that allow them to conserve oxygen efficiently during long
      dives, especially when inactive.
